    The sender materializes selected tensors, optionally casts floating-point

    and sends them as dictionaries whose payload entries are parameter or buffer
    names. The receiver applies the received buckets to the target model with
    ``load_state_dict(strict=False)``.

    The first bucket also carries metadata used by the receiver-side protocol:
    ``_TOTAL_BUCKETS_KEY`` stores the number of buckets to receive, and
    ``_SYNCER_VERSION_KEY`` stores the weight version associated with the
    transfer. These keys are reserved and must not collide with state dict keys.

    Attributes:
        bucket_size: Target maximum bucket payload size in bytes. A single tensor
            is never split, so an individual payload may exceed this value.
        bucket_dtype: Optional dtype used to transport floating-point tensors.
            Non-floating tensors keep their original dtype.
        bucket_device: Device where bucket payload tensors are staged before
